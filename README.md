# OpenLayers

This project is meant to be a quick demo for using OpenLayers 4 with Angular 6. Of all the documentation I have seen for OpenLayers 4, none of it has been used in an Angular 6 project, so I want to share what I have learned.

Here is what I am using:

* Angular 6.0.6
* Angular-cli 6.0.8
* Node 10.4.1 

Everything else can be found in package.json

## Running

In order to run this project, first clone the repo.

* Make sure you have npm installed.
  *  `sudo apt install npm`
* Upgrade to the latest version
  * `sudo npm install -g npm`
* Install Angular-CLI
  * `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`
* Check your version of Node, Angular, and Angular CLI
  * `ng -v`
* Install all of the packages from package.json (once you are in the project directory)
  * `npm install`
* Run the Angular Development Server
  * `ng serve --open`
  * If you just use `ng serve`, open your favorite browser and navigate to localhost:4200.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
